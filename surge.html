Surge Portrait
Surge is a Legendary Brawler who could be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 from Season 2: Summer of Monsters or can be unlocked from the Starr Road. His main attack fires a shot of juice that splits upon hitting an enemy. His Super is a jump in the air which allows him to leap over walls, and upon landing, deals damage, knocks enemies back, and grants Surge various upgrades to his attacks and movement speed. Surge's first Gadget, Power Surge, temporarily gives Surge 1 upgrade. His second Gadget, Power Shield, partially protects Surge from a single projectile that is converted to reload a part of his ammo. His first Star Power, To the Max!, allows his projectiles to split when hitting a wall. His second Star Power, Serve Ice Cold, makes Surge respawn with his Stage 1 upgrade instead of reverting back to his initial state.</h1>
