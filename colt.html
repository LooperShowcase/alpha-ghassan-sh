<h1>Colt is a Rare Brawler who has low health but a high damage output. His attack is a long-ranged volley of six bullets. His Super is a longer-ranged volley of twelve piercing bullets that can destroy obstacles. His first Gadget, Speedloader, instantly reloads two of his ammo. His second Gadget, Silver Bullet, makes his next attack a single piercing bullet that destroys obstacles and deals the damage of two of his main attack's bullets. His first Star Power, Slick Boots, passively increases his movement speed. His second Star Power, Magnum Special, increases his main attack's range and bullet speed. His Hypercharge, Dual Wielding, increases the width of his Super.</h1>
