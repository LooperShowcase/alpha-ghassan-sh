    In Brawl Stars, players battle against other players or AI opponents in multiple game modes. Players can choose between different Brawlers that they have unlocked through the Starr Road, the Brawl Pass, the Trophy Road, or purchased through the Shop to use in battles.[6] In December 2022, Boxes were removed, and all previous methods to get them were replaced with credits and chroma credits, which are used to unlock Brawlers, who are now mostly placed on the "Starr Road".
