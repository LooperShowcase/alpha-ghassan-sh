       <h1>, throws popcorn bags around Fang that explode into popcorn kernels on the ground that explode on contact or after a brief period of time. His second Gadget, Roundhouse Kick, makes Fang spin around fast, briefly stunning nearby enemies. His first Star Power, Fresh Kicks, allows Fang to recharge his Super instantly after defeating an enemy Brawler using his Super. His second Star Power, Divine Soles, periodically grants Fang a special shield that partially reduces damage from the next enemy attack. His Hypercharge, Dragon Kick, makes his Super go through walls and drop pieces of popcorn that behave identically to his first Gadget, each dealing more damage.

<h1>Fang is a Mythic Brawler who could be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 in Season 10: Year of the Tiger, or can be obtained from the Starr Road.</h1>

<h2> He has high health, a high damage output, and a fast movement speed. His attack is a kick that deals high damage, but is short in range. If he doesn't hit an enemy with his kick, his shoe flies off, gaining additional range but dealing a lot less damage. His Super is a powerful kick that makes him fly and deal damage to enemies. If an enemy is nearby the targeted enemy, Fang bounces to them, and he can hit a maximum of 4 enemies with one Super.</h2>
